Software Engineering for AI,Samyan Qayyum Wahla,Fall 2024,"The course takes a software engineering perspective on building software systems with a significant machine learning or AI component. It discusses how to take an idea and a model developed by a data scientist (e.g., scripts and Jupyter notebook) and deploy it as part of scalable and maintainable system (e.g., mobile apps, web applications, IoT devices). Rather than focusing on modeling and learning itself, this course assumes a working relationship with a data scientist and focuses on issues of design, implementation, operation, and assurance and how those interact with the data scientist's modeling.

This course is aimed at software engineers who want to understand the specific challenges of working with AI components and at data scientists who want to understand the challenges of getting a prototype model into production; it facilitates communication and collaboration between both roles.", , , , , , 
Artificial Intelligence (Lab),Samyan Qayyum Wahla,Fall 2024,"This course introduces representations, techniques, and architectures used to build applied systems and to account for intelligence from a computational point of view. This course also explores applications of rule chaining, heuristic search, logic, constraint propagation, constrained search, and other problem-solving paradigms. In addition, it covers applications of decision trees, KNN, Naive Bayes Classifivation, neural nets, and other learning paradigms.", , , , , ,

Signal & Systems,Sahar Waqar,Fall 2024,"The objective of this course is to develop the understanding of the basic ideas of the Signals & Systems encountered in engineering. The main focus will be on the methods for characterizing and analyzing continuous-time and discrete time signals and systems. Students will learn some transform techniques (Laplace transform, Z-transform and Fourier transform) that are useful for the understanding of Digital communication systems, Feedback control systems, Satellite and mobile communications, Digital signal processing and Digital image processing.", , , , , , 
Applications of ICT,Sahar Waqar,Fall 2024,"This course is designed to provide an introduction to the key concepts and technologies used in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and their applications. It will cover a wide range of topics including computer networking, database systems, web development, programming, and mobile application development. The course will also introduce students to the latest trends in the field of ICTs and their applications in various industries, including education, finance, healthcare, security and communications.", , , , , , 
Data Structures and Algorithms,Nazeef Ul Haq,Fall 2024,"The course introduces the theory of complexity and abstract data structures as basic building blocks to structure problem objects for efficient solution. This course will cover the basic approaches and mindsets for analyzing and designing algorithms and data structures into two parts. Topics include the following: Worst and average case analysis. Recurrences and asymptotic. Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and selection. Data structures: linked list, stack, queue, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables. Basic Algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer etc. Algorithms for fundamental graph problems: minimum-cost spanning tree, connected components, topological sort, and shortest paths.", , , , ,"â€¢	1.
